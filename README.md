Scope of this mod:
- Remove bloat from external mods
- Rebalance external mods

All patches are balanced around my mods (and personal modlist). For example, [gene expansion](https://github.com/friedriceworld/gene-expansion) removes genetic aptitudes by default and the VRE Phytokins patch compensates for that metabolism loss. If aptitudes are toggled back on, Phytokin will have +1 metabolism.
