Scope of this mod:
- Remove bloat from external mods
- Rebalance external mods

All patches are balanced around my mods (and personal modlist). For example, [gene expansion](https://github.com/friedriceworld/gene-expansion) removes genetic aptitudes by default and the VRE Phytokins patch compensates for that metabolism loss. If aptitudes are toggled back on, Phytokin will have +1 metabolism.

## Supported Mods
### Combat Extended
- Prevents backpacks from spawning on non-player pawns
- Removes gas masks, melee shield (not the ballistic shield), night vision goggles, and powered exoframe

### GiTS Cyberbrains
- Removes abilities to make the brains less OP and reduce gizmo clutter

### RimThunder Functional Furniture Expanded
- Removes everything but a few of the doors

### Vanilla Apparel Expanded
- Removes most non-specialized apparel
- Prevents most mod apparel from spawning on non-player pawns

### Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Pirates
- Renames rum to pruno (toilet wine)

### Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security

- - Note: C# assemblies call for removed defs which results in harmless red errors at startup
- Allows the player to build ammo crates without researching fabrication

> [!WARNING]
> **Hard incompatibility**: These patches **must** be disabled if Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers is installed.

### Vanilla Psycasts Expanded
- Removes psycaster raids to prevent spacer armor raids (mainly from VFE - Deserters) on my day 20 colony

### Vanilla Races Expanded - Archon
