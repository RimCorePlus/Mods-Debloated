    apparently <handlingTypes><li>Turret</li></handlingTypes> isn't correct
    this patch is supposed to resolve that by replacing offending nodes with the correct syntax
    however, for some reason, this patch is firing an error about applying the patch directly
    no idea what it means, why it's firing, or how to fix it
    will probably delete later-->
